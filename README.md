#HTML file
I had a little bit of trouble customizing the individual labels, spacing was an issue but then i discovered &nbsp; which is awesome!!!
I broke the label and input tabs up with div tags which helped with the visual aspect of the project 
#CSS file
creating a .employees tag was huge when it came to listing out the information that each employee input into the system
#JS file 
I had a bit of trouble with this file even though most of the code was already provided.  I worked with a few classmates on this and they helped navigate me to a functional sight.


# Weekend 1 Challenge Starter Repo

If you want, you can start your project by forking and cloning this repo.

However, feel free to start from scratch,too.

**REMEMBER:** Carefully read the instructions in the assignment app.
##For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employee data, including their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much weâ€™re spending each month.
###NOTE: As always, be sure to create a README.md that tells us about your application. README.md template if you need it.

##The application should first have an input form that collects:
1)The Employee's First and Last name
2)The Employee's ID Number
3)The Employee's Job Title
4)The Employee's Salary (Yearly)

##The form should have a submit button that
1)clears out the form and
2)stores the submitted information.
3)Then, that information should be ###appended to the DOM### so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.
4)Finally, your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back what the monthly cost of salaries is.

##Hard Mode
1)Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. Note that in hard mode, it need not remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

##Pro Mode
1)Once the employee is deleted, also update the total salaries to discount the removed employee's salary. This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. You will need to stretch yourself for this one. I also recommend that you look into jQuery's .data() function to help complete this. Note, you will need to do something both when the employee is added and when they are deleted to make your application 'smart'.

Good Luck, have a great weekend!
